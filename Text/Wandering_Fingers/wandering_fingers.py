Title:
Wandering Fingers

Description:
Software like Swype and SwiftKey lets smartphone users enter text
by dragging their finger over th on-screen keyboard,
rather than tapping on each letter.
You'll be given a string of characters
representing the letters the user has dragged their finger over.
For example, if the user wants "rest",
the string of input characters might be "resdft" or "resert".
Given the following input strings,
find all possible output words 5 characters or longer from:
1. qweryuytresdftyuioknn
2. gijakjthoijerjidsdfnokg
Your program should find all possible words (5+ characters)
that can be derived from the strings supplied.
Use http://norvig.com/ngrams/enable1.txt as your search dictionary.
The order of the output words doesn't matter.
